			<h2>Git Workflow</h2>
			<p>When collabrating with a group on a project each indivdual would have to make their own branch. To make you branch you would use "git checkout "name"". You could also use this command to change branches. There will always be a master branch in which contains the final product of your project and which other branches should merge their work to. After making you branch and working on somethings you would push it up towards your branch by using "git push -origin "name" ". After pushing to your branch you would go to the GitHub website and make a pull request so that you can merge your work into the master branch </p>
